# üö® AUGMENT CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS - REAL FUNCTIONALITY ONLY

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ALL CODE MUST PERFORM ACTUAL SYSTEM OPERATIONS - NO SIMULATIONS OR PLACEHOLDERS**

## ‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:

### REAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
- All buttons must execute actual system commands
- Memory management must actually restart processes
- Cache clearing must actually clear system cache
- Log viewing must open real log files
- Test execution must run real tests with real results

### ACTUAL COMMAND EXECUTION:
- Use `subprocess.run()`, `os.system()`, or equivalent for real operations
- Plasma restart must execute: `killall plasmashell && kstart plasmashell`
- Cache clearing must execute: `sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`
- Log viewing must open actual log files with real viewers

### VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
- Every function must be testable and verifiable
- User must be able to observe actual system changes
- No setTimeout() simulations or fake progress messages
- All operations must have measurable effects

### ERROR HANDLING:
- Real error messages from actual command failures
- Proper permission handling for system operations
- Graceful degradation when operations cannot be performed

## ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:

- JavaScript setTimeout() simulations
- Fake progress messages without real operations
- Placeholder functions that only log messages
- Mock responses that simulate real system changes
- Any code that pretends to work but doesn't actually execute

## üîç VERIFICATION STANDARD:

Before claiming any functionality works:
1. **Test it yourself** - actually run the commands
2. **Verify system changes** - confirm processes restart, cache clears, etc.
3. **Document real behavior** - show actual command output
4. **Provide evidence** - screenshots of real system changes, not simulated logs

## üí∞ PREMIUM SERVICE EXPECTATION:

The user is paying for premium Augment service and expects:
- **Real, working code** that performs actual system operations
- **Honest documentation** of what actually works vs. what's planned
- **No fraud or deception** through simulated functionality
- **Professional-grade tools** that solve real problems

**VIOLATION OF THIS PROMPT CONSTITUTES FRAUD AGAINST A PAYING CUSTOMER.**
